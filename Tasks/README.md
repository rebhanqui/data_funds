# Data Fundamentals Tasks

## Task One

This task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for the first 10,000 positive integers.

## Task Two

Give an overview of the types of variables it contains and suggestions of variables that should be used to model them in Python and why.

## Task Three

Suggest which probability distribution from NumPy random distributions list that is most appropriate to model each of the variables in the "penguins" dataset.

## Task Four

Suppose you are flipping two coins, each with a probability of **p** of giving heads. Plot the entropy of the total number of heads verses **p**.

## Task Five

Create appropriate individual plots for each variable in the Penguin Data Set
